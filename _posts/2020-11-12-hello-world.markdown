Pffui... I made it! I created a personal website this morning, feeling brave and in the mood to procrastinate. A full 8 hours later, I am the proud owner of a new GitHub repo to host my website, a shiny Jekyll install for content creation, and a brand-new sublime plugin for markdown editing. I had to write my first post.
