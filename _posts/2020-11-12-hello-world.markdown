Pffui... I made it! This morning feeling brave and in the mood to procrastrinate, I decided to create a personal website. A full 8h laters I am the proud owner of a new github repo, to host my website, a shiny jekyll  install for content creation and a brand-new sublime plugin for markdown editing. I had to write my first post.
