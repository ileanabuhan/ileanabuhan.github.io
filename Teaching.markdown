**Master Thesis and Research Internships**

If you like embedded systems and are looking for a project which mixes hands-on work with just the right amount of theory contact me. Depending on your skills and interestes we will define together a nice project for you. 



**In progress**

- *Annotation of power traces*, (Master thesis),  A power traces is a time series which represents a set of events as executed by a physical device. Altough we know which instructions, the target device is executing, the micro-architecture implementation is unknown and will influence the execution of instructions. In this project we explore techniques to annotate sampels in the power trace with the corresponding instructions. 
- *A closer look at identifying leaking components in chips during design stage*, (Master thesis), In this project we compare  the merits of two distinct leakage identification measures for identifying leakage in hardware modules. 
- *Calculating the vulnerability remediation order based on open source intelligence* @Northwave, (Master thesis), Organizations use vulnerability scans to gain insight in the level of security of the digital infrastructure. Results of such a scan are scored using Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS).  In this projectwe develop a score calculation method based on which organiza- tions can select the best follow-up actions with most impact on the security level of the organization. We develop multiple calculation methods which we test on real vulnerability scanning data. We conduct a survey on experts in the field, and based on their expertise, we recommend the most suitable method for vulnerability management.
- *Evaluating the impact of ransomware* @Northwave, (Master thesis), tbd
