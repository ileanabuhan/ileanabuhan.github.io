**Master Thesis and Research Internships**

If you like embedded systems and are looking for a project which mixes hands-on work with just the right amount of theory contact me. Depending on your skills and interestes we will define together a nice project for you. I have listed some available topics below. 

Research Internships/Batchelor thesis

*Difficulty: required programming skills, no prior experience with hardware is needed.*

- *Data visualization*. This project aims to capture the evolution of the processing capabilities of pre-silicon tooling when analyzing hardware implementations in academic research papers. The parameters of interest are time, design complexity, abstraction layer, etc. Data extraction is included in the project.

  *Difficulty:  understanding the hardware language is useful, but not stricly required.*



**In progress**

- *Building complex leakage models* (Master thesis) @Riscure This project investigates the use of benchmark codes  for the purpose of identifying the source of the leakages which threaten masked implementations  to ensure 1st order security. *(from January 2022)*

- *Annotation of power traces*, (Master thesis),  A power traces is a time series which represents a set of events as executed by a physical device. Altough we know which instructions, the target device is executing, the micro-architecture implementation is unknown and will influence the execution of instructions. In this project we explore techniques to annotate sampels in the power trace with the corresponding instructions. 

- *Power-based Side-Channel Instruction-level Disassembler* (Master thesis)@Minister van Binnenlandse Zaken; 

- *Evaluating the impact of ransomware* @Northwave, (Master thesis); 

- *Efficient, cost effective sniffing for SPI and I2C* protocols for an Arduino microcontroller, (Batchelor  thesis);

- *Threat analysis of an industrial system* @GAIN (Research internship) (from February 2022);
