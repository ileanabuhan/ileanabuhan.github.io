**Master Thesis and Research Internships**

If you like embedded systems and are looking for a project which mixes hands-on work with just the right amount of theory contact me. Depending on your skills and interestes we will define together a nice project for you. I have listed some available topics below. 

*Research Internships/Batchelor thesis*

- *Data visualization*. This project aims to capture the evolution of the processing capabilities of pre-silicon tooling when analyzing hardware implementations in academic research papers. The parameters of interest are time, design complexity, abstraction layer, etc. Data extraction is included in the project.

**In progress**

- **Master thesis**: *Building complex leakage models*  @Riscure This project investigates the use of benchmark codes  for the purpose of identifying the source of the leakages which threaten masked implementations  to ensure 1st order security. 
- **Master thesis**:  *Annotation of power traces* In this project we explore techniques to annotate sampels in the power trace with the corresponding instructions. 
- **Master thesis**: *Power-based Side-Channel Instruction-level Disassembler* @Minister van Binnenlandse Zaken; 
- **Master thesis:**  *Evaluating the impact of ransomware* @Northwave ; 
- **Batchelor  thesis**:  *Efficient, cost effective sniffing for SPI and I2C* protocols for an Arduino microcontroller;
