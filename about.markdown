Hi, since 2020, I am back to academia as an assistant professor of cryptographic engineering in the Digital Security group at the Institute for Computing and Information Sciences of the Radboud University Nijmegen. 

Today, my main research interest is hardware security with special emphasis on techniques for leakage detection and I am currently working on making tools to help designers of cryptographic algorithms develop secure implementations. Below a short overview of my professional career.

In my free time, I run,  [draw](https://www.instagram.com/pufuletica/), and serve as PC member several conference related to hardware security.
